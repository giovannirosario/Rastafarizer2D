Rastafarizer2D (2D Rasterizer Programming Project)
# 1. Introduction
A [rasterizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation) is a program that takes in the description of vector shapes and converts that description into a raster image, i.e. a matrix of pixels.

Rastafarizer2D receives as input a scene description file coded in JSON (https://www.json.org/) and outputs an image in PPM format that contains the rasterization of all Two-Dimensional (2D) primitives described in the input 'scene.json' file.

# 2. Supported Primitives
Currently the Rastafarizer2D project supports the following primitives:
1. **Line Segment** defined by two points, a color and thickness. Implemented in Bresenham Line Generation Algorithm. 
2. **Circles** defined by a center point and a radius. Implemented in the Midpoint Algorithm.
3. **Polylines** defined by a set of vertex points.
4. **Polygon** defined by a set of vertex points, stroke and fill colors and stroke thickness.

# 3. Collor Filling Algorithms
1. **ScanLine Algorithm** To fill the color of Polygon primitives a ScanLine Algorithm is used.
2. **Flood Fill** Flood filling is also supported. Must be provided a start point and desired Color. All Flood Fill actions must be put in the scene file, in the "flood_fill" array, after the primitive objects.
3. **Circle Fill** To fill the color of Circle primitives a different algorithm was used, based on the Midpoint Algorithm.

# 4. Anti-aliasing
Anti-aliasing is currently not supported but will be implemented soon.


# 5. Scene File Manual

**Colors**  The scene file receives color in a 6-digit hexadecimal format. This guarantees support to any possible color in that format.(www.color-hex.com) is a good reference to pick. Color Pallete may be implemented soon.


1. **General** 

The scene file follows a JSON format using Key, Value, Arrays and Child objects.
You must start your scene with the keys "width", "height", "background_color" and provide according value to each of them. 

```json
{
  "width": 800,
  "height": 600,
  "background_color": "000000",
  "objects": [ "..." ],
  "flood_fill":["..."]

```

After that, you must start a key "objects" and place an JSON Array as it's value. Than each object in that array will be treated as the follow examples:


2. **Line** 
```json
{
    "type":"line",
    "color":"FF3333",
    "thickness":3,
    "start":[320,195],
    "end":[355,195]
}
```

3. **Circle**
```json
{
    "type":"circle",
    "stroke_color":"230192",
    "fill_color":"FF3333",
    "start":[60,60],
    "radius":30
}
```
4. **Polygon**
```json
 {
    "type":"polygon",
    "stroke_color":"FF3333",
    "fill_color":"010101",
    "thickness":1,
    "points":[350,75,379,161,469,161,397,215,423,301,350,250,277,301,303,215,231,161,321,161]
},
```
5. **Polyline**
```json
{
    "type":"polyline",
    "stroke_color":"FF3333",
    "thickness":1,
    "points":[350,75,379,161,469,161,397,215,423,301,350,250,277,301,303,215,231,161,321,161]
}
```

And finally in the "flood_fill" key you may provide an array of all desired Flood Fill with it's start point and desired color.

6. **Flood Fill**
```json
{
    "color":"0000FF",
    "start":[350,200]
}
```

An example file is provided in the project folder as the name "scene.json"
